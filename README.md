# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Neural-Network
Brain Tumor Detection using Neural Networks utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and classify tumors from MRI or CT scans. The model learns patterns from preprocessed images during training, enabling accurate prediction of tumors in new scans.
